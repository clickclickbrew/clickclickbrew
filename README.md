- ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Dave.
- ðŸ‘” Iâ€™m in IT by trade: Field Technician, CCNA certified. But that came from a lifelong interest in many facets of tech, from being a kid who made sprite animation videos, installed custom firmware on iPods and phones, and made some small attempts at making games in flash.
- ðŸŒ± I'm picking back up on Python and Java, languages I saw in college, to strengthen my background in programming/scripting.
